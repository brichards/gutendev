This plugin is designed to be the instructional companion to the [WordCamp Miami 2018 Developer workshop](https://2018.miami.wordcamp.org/friday-developers/).

== Description ==

In its default state this plugin does nothing. To enable each custom block, edit the `gutendev.php` file to include each separate section. The `*-complete` directory includes final working code for each lesson. Include these directories to see what the final outcome should be like.

== Installation ==

This plugin can be installed like every other WordPress plugin:

1. Add this plugin's folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (e.g. `git clone git@github.com:brichards/gutendev.git`)
1. Activate the plugin either via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or via WP-CLI (e.g. `wp plugin activate gutendev`)
